                    <p>Good morning, the board. Chairmen and CEOs, merging companies
and potential investors. Welcome to the world’s first
emotional and ethically challenged private organization. We
have positions opening for scientists, engineers, artists,
filmmakers, special effect artists to architects and
spiritualists. There are over a hundred different vacancies
for mass employment.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="gray-text">(Challenging self questioning)</h4>
                    
                    <p>But the principles according to this futuristic empire,
strikes me as bias and almost dictatorial. I am obviously
addressing the questionable rules within its code of conduct.
It seeks a particular group! Everyone must be heterosexual,
surrogating the fact this company does not accept
homosexuality, when the current world is opening up a relaxed
manner on the issue. Furthermore we see that disabilities are
completely scored out. A cold hearted approach to equality
indeed.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="gray-text">(Building up anguish)</h4>
                    
                    <p>I like to interject also the section in the employee’s
application stating in the condition of “couplings”. I will
read out bluntly word for word. “Should any applicant be the
bearer of a child or pending to be the bearer of any potential
infant(s) shall not be granted with job title applied. Whereas
any existing employees with the acknowledgment of any offspring(
s) or pending, will be rejected from the work force
AFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.”</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="gray-text">(Building up argumentative sarcasm)</h4>
                    
                    <p>To top these already sensitive subjects, we have a personal
attack on people who are “dappers”. Dappers derived from
humans whom choose to eat with their mouth open, like an
animal, creating a “dapping” type of irritating noise.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="gray-text">(Ridiculously humoring off)</h4>
                    
                    <p>To be rejected from a job position because potential employees
eats loud does not compute to the great and hard work these
individuals may perform to service acquired tasks. But these
branded clauses are extremely personal and somewhat ridiculous
as a whole!</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="gray-text">(Creating	fearsome	warnings	and	extremism)</h4>
                    
                    <p>Concluding the entirely of this futuristic body to be
                    recognised as a sort of fascistic, sexist, and homophobic
                    as well as anti-birth entity without dappers. Excluding
                    the so-called “lesser applicants” from operating state of
                    the art high-end technologies with newly established
                    advances of the highly evolved. Quoting loudly like a
                    dictator:- <u>that	the	future	is	not	for	everyone	but	only	a	handsome	few	
                    whom	is	of	specific intelligence	and	environmentally	friendly	plus
